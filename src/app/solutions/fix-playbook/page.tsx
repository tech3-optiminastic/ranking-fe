  {
    question: "What is a GEO Fix Playbook?",
    answer:
      "The prioritized, ship-ready set of actions Signalor generates after auditing your site against how generative AI engines decide what to cite — each scored by expected visibility lift and effort.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Signalor decide which fixes have the most impact?",
    answer:
      "Every recommendation is scored against expected citation lift, signal strength on the engines you track, and your current baseline. Quick wins on top, compounding investments below — never random.",
  },
  {
    question: "What AI visibility issues does Signalor detect?",
    answer:
      "Missing entities, weak citations, content structure issues, missing or broken schema, low authority signals, llms.txt and robots.txt issues, and EEAT gaps — across six GEO pillars.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the Fix Playbook integrate with Shopify and WordPress?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Schema and content fixes apply with one click from the recommendation card. Manual recommendations include the exact markup, copy, or code to ship.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I assign recommendations to teammates?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Shared workspaces let you assign owners, track in-progress and shipped, and watch the verify step prove each fix landed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fast do shipped fixes register?",
    answer:
      "Schema and technical fixes register inside 24–72 hours. Content, EEAT, and authority compound over two to six weeks. Every recommendation tells you which bucket it's in.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Signalor auto-fix or only recommend?",
    answer:
      "Both. Safe fixes (Organization schema, FAQ markup, llms.txt, AI meta tags) auto-apply on Shopify and WordPress. Editorial work stays in your team's hands with full context.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are recommendations prioritized for B2B SaaS vs Shopify brands?",
    answer:
      "Same scoring engine, different weights. Shopify surfaces Product and Review schema first; B2B SaaS surfaces EEAT and comparison content. Prioritization reflects what each category actually rewards.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between a recommendation and an action?",
    answer:
      "A recommendation describes the gap. An action is the explicit next step. Every recommendation resolves into at least one action so nothing stays abstract.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I export the playbook as a PDF?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Every audit produces a branded PDF with the prioritized playbook, expected impact, and a diff from the previous run.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the verify step work?",
    answer:
      "After you mark a recommendation as shipped, Signalor re-checks the affected page or signal and tracks citation impact through the next audit cycle. If a fix didn't land, verify flags it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the Fix Playbook free?",
    answer:
      "A baseline playbook is free for any public URL. Saved workspaces, scheduled re-audits, and one-click apply unlock on paid plans.",
  },
