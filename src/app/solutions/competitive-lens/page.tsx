    question: "What is competitive AI visibility benchmarking?",
    answer:
      "A side-by-side comparison of how often you and your competitors appear in generative AI answers — across mentions, citations, and recommendation rate — for the prompts that decide consideration.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Signalor pick which competitors to track?",
    answer:
      "We auto-suggest competitors AI engines already cite alongside you. Add, remove, or pin any brand. Pro tracks up to five; Max is unlimited.",
  },
  {
    question: "Share of voice vs. citation share — what's the difference?",
    answer:
      "Share of voice is mention frequency. Citation share is whether your URL is actually linked or quoted. Both matter: one is awareness, the other is traffic and authority.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I see why a competitor is winning AI citations?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Lens surfaces the signal causing each gap — schema, content depth, EEAT, entity graph — and each one resolves into a ranked fix.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Signalor identify emerging competitors?",
    answer:
      "We watch the source list each AI engine cites. When a new brand surfaces in the top three over multiple runs, it's flagged with a confidence score.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I segment by region or AI engine?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Per-engine, per-region, and per-prompt breakdowns are first-class — so you can see whether your gap is global, local, or model-specific.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are content gaps and authority gaps?",
    answer:
      "A content gap is a topic competitors win and you don't appear for. An authority gap is a topic where you have content but lack the trust signals to be cited.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Signalor track AI recommendation rate per competitor?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Recommendation rate is tracked separately from mentions because being championed is different from being merely listed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do strategic recommendations work?",
    answer:
      "Each gap becomes a ranked move with expected citation lift relative to the specific competitor you're closing the gap against.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I export competitive reports?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Branded PDFs and shareable URLs with citation share, gap analysis, emerging competitors, and ranked moves.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fresh is competitive data?",
    answer:
      "Snapshots reflect the engine runs at audit time. Saved workspaces re-run on your schedule, with alerts on threshold changes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Competitive Lens on every plan?",
    answer:
      "Full Competitive Lens unlocks on Pro and Max. Starter includes baseline competitive context inside the visibility report.",
  },
